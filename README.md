PROJECT: Odin Project Lasagna Recipe Site (with Index Homepage)

Pre Project Notes: This is my very first attempt at building a website!

I'm following the steps set out by the Odin Project.

I can't wait to get started

First attempt complete:

That's my very first attempt at building a basic HTML site complete.

Throughout this Odin Project lesson, I learned the basics of HTML boilerplates, adding images to the site, creating links to other pages on the site and how to upload all of this onto Github.

One area I struggled with at first was how to get the image to load properly onto the site. After researching this issue I realised I had not moved the jpg into the correct file, and I needed to paste the full path into VS code in order to see the image correctly on the site.

Now, it's time for me to learn the basics of CSS so I can begin improving the layout of the site and make it look more appealing

14/4/2023 15:41 Updated the site to make the text easier to read and the steps easier to follow for the lasagna recipe. I realised that I had made coded the ordered and unordered list for the ingredients and steps incorrectly. I pasted the text into the list and I didnt add the individual list
tags for each item. This has now been updated and the lists are now clear and easy to read as well as looking much better.
