Pre-Project Notes:
This is my very first attempt at building a website!

I'm following the steps set out by the Odin Project.

I can't wait to get started


First attempt complete:

That's my very first attempt at building a basic HTML site complete. 

Throughout this Odin Project lesson, I learned the basics of HTML boilerplates,
adding images to the site, creating links to other pages on the site and
how to upload all of this onto Github.

One area I struggled with at first was how to get the image to load properly onto
the site. After researching this issue I realised I had not moved the jpg into
the correct file, and I needed to paste the full path into VS code in order to see
the image correctly on the site.

Now, it's time for me to learn the basics of CSS so I can begin improving the layout
of the site and make it look more appealing
